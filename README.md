# Superstore Sales Analysis - Tableau Project
## Overview
This project involves analyzing Superstore's sales and profitability data using Tableau. The goal is to uncover key insights across different regions, product categories, and customer segments from 2014 to 2017. Through interactive dashboards and visualizations, the analysis identifies trends, performance drivers, and opportunities for business growth.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used for this analysis is the Sample Superstore dataset, which includes sales, profit, order, and customer data from 2014 to 2017 across different regions in the United States. The dataset contains three tables:
* Orders: Detailed transaction data including Sales, Profit, Quantity, and Customer details.
* Returns: Information about product returns.
* People: Data on Superstore employees and their associated regions.

Key metrics analyzed include:
* Sales
* Profit
* Quantity
* Customer Segments
* Regions
  
The dataset comprises 21 fields and 9,994 rows in the Orders table, providing a comprehensive view of the company's sales performance and customer behavior.

## Project Objectives
* Sales and Profit Trends: Identify key trends in Superstore's sales and profitability over time and across regions.
* Regional Performance: Analyze sales and profit contributions by region to highlight the strongest and weakest performing areas.
* Product Category Insights: Evaluate product category performance, with a focus on identifying high-profit and low-profit categories.
* Customer Behavior: Understand customer segmentation and identify the most profitable customer segments.
* Actionable Insights: Provide data-driven recommendations for improving performance in underperforming regions and product categories.

## Key Visualizations and Insights
* Regional Sales and Profit Analysis
The West region is the top performer, contributing $725,458 in sales and $108,418 in profit, while the Central region lags in both sales and profitability.
Strategies should focus on improving sales in the South and Central regions to drive overall growth.
* Monthly Sales Trends (2014-2017)
Sales show a general upward trend from 2014 to 2017, with significant growth in 2016 and 2017.
November and December consistently deliver the highest sales, likely driven by holiday shopping.
January and February consistently report the lowest sales, suggesting a potential area for strategic improvements.
* Product Category and Subcategory Performance
Technology products account for 36.4% of total sales, making it the top-performing product category. Investing further in Technology could drive even more growth.
Phones and Chairs are the highest-selling subcategories, each generating over $300K in sales.
Subcategories like Art and Supplies show weaker sales, indicating areas that may need additional marketing or product revisions.
* Profitability by Region and State
California and New York generate the highest profits, while states like Texas, Pennsylvania, and Ohio report negative profits, indicating underperformance in these regions.
The West region overall has the highest profit contribution, while the Central region has the lowest.
* Customer Segmentation and Sales Distribution
The Consumer segment is the most profitable, with total sales of $1,161,401 and high profit margins.
Corporate and Home Office segments also perform well but contribute less than the Consumer segment.
Strategies focusing on the Consumer segment may drive the highest returns.
* Order Quantity Distribution
Most orders fall within the 2-6 item range, with larger orders being rare. This pattern suggests that inventory management should prioritize stocking lower quantities of frequently ordered items.

## Tools and Technologies
* Tableau: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
* Excel: For initial data cleaning and preparation.

## Conclusion & Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are made:

* Regional Focus: Invest in targeted marketing strategies for the South and Central regions to drive sales growth.
* Product Strategy: Further promote Technology products, which consistently deliver high sales and profit. Additionally, reassess the Furniture category for better cost management, as it shows mixed profitability.
* Customer Engagement: Focus marketing efforts on the Consumer segment, which contributes the most to sales and profit, while also exploring ways to increase sales in the Corporate and Home Office segments.
* Inventory Optimization: Align inventory management with the most commonly ordered quantities (2-6 items), while also preparing for holiday sales spikes in November and December.
